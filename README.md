# redux-for-dummies
Simple react with redux example for dummies.

This repo provide examples separated into multiple branches.
- `base`. Base app that will variates into examples with different state management and props-ing stategy.
- `use-redux`. Base app that use "standard" redux that use `connect` for all components connected to redux.
- `redux-useselector-usedispatch`. Similar with `use-redux`, but use `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks for some `functional component`.
- `react-context`. Base app without redux, but use React's `Context API` to avoid props drilling. Examples provided are for `class component`, `functional component`, and with `useContext` hooks.
