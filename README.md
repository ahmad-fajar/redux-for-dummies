# redux-for-dummies

Example in this branch use old fashioned React and without state management i.e: redux.
Parent component get (fetch) data and propped down to children, simple component use `functional` instead of `class` component, and functional component remain "dumb" (have neither `lifeCycle` nor local `state`).
