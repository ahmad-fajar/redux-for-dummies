# redux-for-dummies

Do not want to use redux, but want to avoid **props drilling**?. Use react `Context API`.

This branch provide examples on how to use `context` for both `class` and `functional` components.

Context is not always the best solution to simply avoid drilling. **Consumer** components will always receive all values provided by **Provider**.
